# Looping Animation CSS Library

A lightweight, ready-to-use CSS library for adding continuous, looping animations to your web projects. Just add a class to an element, and it will animate forever.

---

## How to Use

Using the library is simple. Follow these two steps:

**1. Link the Stylesheet**

First, include the `looping-animations.css` file in the `<head>` of your HTML document.

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/looping-animations.css">
</head>
```

**2. Add an Animation Class**

Next, add the desired animation class to any HTML element you want to animate. All animations in this library loop by default.

```html
<!-- This div will float up and down continuously -->
<div class="float-y">I'm floating!</div>

<!-- This icon will spin forever -->
<i class="spin">ðŸ”„</i>
```

## Customization

You can easily customize any animation by editing the CSS file. Feel free to change properties like `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function`, or the transform values inside the `@keyframes` to better suit your needs.
